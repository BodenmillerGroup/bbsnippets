### Example Flow cytometry analysis in R.

This script describes an example analysis for cyTOF data in R. 

The base of this script was developed beginning of 2016 and only slighlty changed since. Thus it is likely that there are better ways to dot his nowadays!
Alternative resources for cyTOF analysis are:

  - http://cytof.biosurf.org/#!/cytof
  - https://www.jimmunol.org/content/200/1/3
  - https://github.com/lmweber/FlowSOM-Rtsne-example
  
Note that the part of the script after data loading, can be also used for IMC data quantified via CellProfiler: https://bodenmillergroup.github.io/bbsnippets/#/snippets/imc/Read_CPoutput_R/README

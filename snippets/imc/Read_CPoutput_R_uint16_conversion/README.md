### Read CellProfiler output for downstream analysis in R

Example how to read and prepare single-cell data and image metadata from CellProfiler in R. This R workflow is adapted to the latest IMCSegmentationPipeline version (post-commit 31ef9ab) output (reconversion of uint16 intensities). Other than the uint16 reconversion, no data normalization or transformation is included here (for that see bbRexamples).

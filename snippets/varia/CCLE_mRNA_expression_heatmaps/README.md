### CCCLE cell line mRNA expression

Snippet to load Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE) mRNA data and plot basic expression heat map for in-house cell lines. Furthermore, cell lines with a in general high expression (treshold can be adapted) and cell line with max expression for each target protein are plotted.

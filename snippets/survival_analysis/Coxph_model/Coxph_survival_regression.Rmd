# Read in survival data
```{r}
library(data.table)

library(dplyr)

surv_dat = fread('../../../data/survival_example_data.csv',header = TRUE)
head(surv_dat)

```

Column description:  
 PID: patient identifier  
 grade: tumor pathology grade  
 OSmonth: overall suvival from time of diagnosis [months]  
 DFSmonth: disease free survival from time of diagnosis [months]  
 Patientstatus: life/death status   
  "death by primary disease" = death due to disease  
  "death" = disease unrelated death  
  "alive" = alive at given survival time  
  "alive w metastases" = alive with metasatses at given survival time  


# Prepare censoring information

Survival data is censored when the event has not yet occurred for a patient
at a given time or the patient is lost to follow-up during the study.
A more detailed explanation can be found here: 
http://www.sthda.com/english/wiki/survival-analysis-basics#censoring

```{r}
# Censoring for overall survival (1 = event (death due to disease), 0 = censored)
surv_dat[,censoringOS := 0]
surv_dat[Patientstatus == 'death by primary disease',censoringOS := 1]

# Censoring for disease free survival (1 = event (recurrence), 0 = censored)
surv_dat[ ,censoringDFS := 0]
surv_dat[ Patientstatus == 'alive w metastases',censoringDFS := 1]
surv_dat[ OSmonth > DFSmonth, censoringDFS := 1]

```

# Coxph survival model for grade groups

Covariates passed to the coxph model can be continuous or categorical.
With categorical covariates each level is considered a distinct group
and the first level is used as reference.

```{r}
# Set reference level for grade groups (first level)
surv_dat[,grade := factor(grade,levels = 1:3)]

# Calculate coxph model. The formula requires a standard survival object
# built with the Surv function from the "survival" package. In the survival
# object a plus behind the time indicates censoring.
res = coxph(Surv(OSmonth, censoringOS) ~ grade , data =  surv_dat)
summary(res)
```

The output contains:  
Pr(>|z|): Wald statistic of whether the coefficient is statistically significantly
different from 0. Grade 3 is significant.  
coef: For the regression coefficients a positive sign represents higher risk of death and
a negative sign lower risk. Grade 3 has a higher risk of death compared to grade 1.    
exp(coef): The exponent of the coefficient is the hazard ratio. Grade 3 patients have a
risk that is increased by a factor of 9 compared to grade 1.  
The global statistical significance of the model can be found at the bottom of the output.
